# Movie Recommender System

This project provides a movie recommendation system using Python, which processes and analyzes movie data to generate personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. The core functionalities are built using a combination of machine learning techniques and data processing with the `TMDB 5000 Movies` dataset.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: Main application file, responsible for running the recommendation engine and serving recommendations.
- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model experimentation for generating recommendations.
- **movie_list.pkl**: Serialized Python object file storing processed movie data, enabling efficient loading and serving of recommendations.
- **README.md**: Detailed documentation of the project, including setup instructions, features, and usage guide.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages and dependencies.
- **tmdb_5000_movies.csv**: Dataset containing movie information, including titles, genres, and other relevant metadata.

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: The `requirements.txt` file includes some common libraries used in data processing and machine learning:
- `requests`
- `scikit-learn`

## Features

- **Movie Recommendation**: Based on user-provided preferences, the app provides personalized movie suggestions.
- **Data Processing**: Processes movie data to structure and filter information for recommendation generation.
- **Modeling and Experimentation**: Uses machine learning models and data analysis techniques to improve recommendation accuracy.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd movie-recommender
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the main application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. Open and explore `notebook.ipynb` for additional analysis and model insights.

## Dataset

The `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` file contains the primary dataset used in this project. It includes movie titles, genres, production details, and other metadata for building a recommendation engine.
