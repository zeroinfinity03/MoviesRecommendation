# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a Movie Recommendation System that utilizes machine learning algorithms to suggest movies based on user preferences. The system leverages movie data from the TMDB dataset and uses various features to make recommendations.

## Features

- **Movie Data Handling**: Processes movie data from the TMDB dataset.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a machine learning model to provide personalized movie recommendations.
- **Web Application**: A Flask-based web application that allows users to interact with the recommendation system.

## Files in the Project

- `app.py`: The main application file that contains the code for running the Flask web application.
- `notebook.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that explores and processes the movie dataset, and trains the recommendation model.
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: The dataset containing movie information used for building the recommendation system.
- `movie_list.pkl`: A serialized file that stores a list of movies or processed data for quick access in the application.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.
